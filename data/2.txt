# What are Gems?
---
Packages that you can download, install, and use in your Ruby programs or from the command line.

# What happens when you run `gem install GEM_NAME`?

The `gem` command connects to the remote library, downlaods the appropriate Gems, and installs them.

# Where are gems installed on your computer?
---
The exact location depends on your setup. Run `gem env` and look for "INSTALLATION DIRECTORY" to see where `gem` installs Gems by default.
