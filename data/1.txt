# What is XMLHttpRequest?
---
One of the browser APIs that provide network programming functionality to JavaScript applications. Libraries or utility functions often wrap this web API.
The name comes from its original use, which was to fetch XML documents over HTTP. Today, we use this object to load any data (typically HTML or JSON) and can use other protocols (including file://) as well.

# What is AJAX?
---
AJAX is short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Its main feature is that it allows browsers to issue requests and process responses without a full page refresh.

AJAX requests are just like normal requests: they are sent to the server with all the normal components of an HTTP request, and the server handles them like any other request. The only difference is that instead of the browser refreshing and processing the response, the response is processed by a callback function, which is usually some client-side JavaScript code.

# What is an API?
---
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
They provide functionality for use by another program.

Examples:
- Every programming language has a built-in API that is used to write programs.
- Mobile devices provide APIs to provide access to location or other sensor data, such as the device's GPS location or the orientation of the device.
- Operating systems have APIs that programs can use to open files, access memory, draw text on the screen, etc.

# What are web APIs?
---
APIs that use the HTTP protocol.

# What is an API provider? What is an API consumer?
---
API provider: the system that provides an API for other parties to use.
GitHub is the provider of the GitHub API, and Dropbox is the provider of the Dropbox API.

API consumer: the system that uses the API to accomplish some work.
When you check the weather on your phone, it is running a program that is consuming a weather API to retrieve forecast data.
