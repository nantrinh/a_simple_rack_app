# What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?
---
An in-memory object representation of an HTML document.
A hierarchy of nodes.
It provides a way to interact with a web page using JavaScript and provides the functionality needed to build modern interactive user experiences.

# Why do browsers insert elements into the DOM that are missing from the HTML?
---
A fundamental tenet of the web is permissiveness. Browsers always do their best to display HTML, even when it has errors.

# Are all text nodes the same?
---
Yes. However, developers sometimes make a distinction between empty nodes (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) and text nodes that contain content (words, numbers, symbols, etc.).

# Are empty nodes reflected visually in the browser?
---
No, but they are in the DOM, so do not neglect them.

# True or False: there is a direct one-to-one mapping between the tags that appear in an HTML file and the nodes in the DOM.
---
False. The browser may insert nodes that don't appear in the HTML due to invalid markup or the omission of optional tags. Text, including whitespace, also creates nodes that don't map to tags.

# Does this JavaScript run?
---
alert('Hello world!');
